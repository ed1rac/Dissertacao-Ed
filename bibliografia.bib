In particular, if algorithm A outperforms algorithm B on some cost functions, then loosely speaking there must exist exactly as many other functions where B outperforms A. Starting from this we analyze a number of the other a priori characteristics of the search problem, like its geometry and its information-theoretic aspects. This analysis allows us to derive mathematical benchmarks for assessing a particular search algorithm's performance. We also investigate minimax aspects of the search problem, the validity of using characteristics of a partial search over a cost function to predict future behavior of the search algorithm on that cost function, and time-varying cost functions. We conclude with some discussion of the justifiablility of biologically-inspired search methods.},

By simple definition, in classification/clustering analyze a set of data and generate a set of grouping rules which can be used to classify future data. Data mining is the process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure. It is the computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The actual data mining task is the automatic or semi-automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns. Data mining involves six common classes of tasks. Anomaly detection, Association rule learning, Clustering, Classification, Regression, Summarization. Classification is a major technique in data mining and widely used in various fields. Classification is a data mining (machine learning) technique used to predict group membership for data instances. In this paper, we present the basic classification techniques. Several major kinds of classification method including decision tree induction, Bayesian networks, k-nearest neighbor classifier, the goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of different classification techniques in data mining.},

In this paper, data mining techniques were utilized to build a classification model to predict the performance of employees. To build the classification model the CRISP-DM data mining methodology was adopted. Decision tree was the main data mining tool used to build the classification model, where several classification rules were generated. To validate the generated model, several experiments were conducted using real data collected from several companies. The model is intended to be used for predicting new applicants' performance.},

It covers fundamental modern topics in machine learning while providing the theoretical basis and conceptual tools needed for the discussion and justification of algorithms. It also describes several key aspects of the application of these algorithms. The authors aim to present novel theoretical tools and concepts while giving concise proofs even for relatively advanced topics. 
                    Foundations of Machine Learning is unique in its focus on the analysis and theory of algorithms. The first four chapters lay the theoretical foundation for what follows; subsequent chapters are mostly self-contained. Topics covered include the Probably Approximately Correct ({PAC}) learning framework; generalization bounds based on Rademacher complexity and {VC}-dimension; Support Vector Machines ({SVMs}); kernel methods; boosting; on-line learning; multi-class classification; ranking; regression; algorithmic stability; dimensionality reduction; learning automata and languages; and reinforcement learning. Each chapter ends with a set of exercises. Appendixes provide additional material including concise probability review.This second edition offers three new chapters, on model selection, maximum entropy models, and conditional entropy models. New material in the appendixes includes a major section on Fenchel duality, expanded coverage of concentration inequalities, and an entirely new entry on information theory. More than half of the exercises are new to this edition.},

Neural networks and its application in information retrieval systems
Abstract
Neural networks are a field of Computer Science related to Artificial Intelligence. The field aims at implementing mathematical models that are similar to biological neural structures. It is also capable of adapting its parameters as a result of interactions with the external environment, gradually improving their performance in the solution of a particular task. By using neural networks in computer information retrieval systems one can assign a dynamic character to those systems by allowing the representation of documents to be reevaluated and modified according to specifications of relevance attributed by users to retrieved documents. This work presents the main initiatives in applying neural networks concepts to information retrieval systems and evaluates its applicability to large document databases as is the case of the Web.

The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated.

This challenge has been considered for several years within the distributed systems management research community and we have recently seen policy-based management emerge as one such promising exemplification. The focus of our work has been predominantly on supporting the requirements of large evolving enterprises. Such environments present a significant challenge for policy-based management as the fluidity and complexity of interactions occurring in such environments mean that prevailing static-based specification and analysis of policies and roles, would be inadequate in many instances. We are therefore interested in providing support for a dynamic policy-based management environment. This paper discusses the critical nature of providing both dynamic and static conflict detection and resolution and introduces a scalable computationally-efficient dynamic conflict detection mechanism.},

These objectives are typically set out in the form of policies that are interpreted by the system managers. There are benefits to be gained by providing automated support for human managers, or actually automating routine management tasks. To do this, it is desirable to have a model of policies as objects that can be interpreted by the system itself. The model is summarized. It is clear that there is the potential for conflicts between policies. These conflicts may be resolved informally by human managers, but if an automated system is to recognize them and resolve them appropriately, first it is necessary to analyze the types of conflict that may occur. We analyze the types of overlap that may occur between policies, and show that this analysis corresponds to several familiar types of policy conflict. Some possible approaches to the prevention and resolution of conflicts are suggested, and this work is put into the context of other work on policies and related areas, including deontic logic.},

	title = {Verificação de conflitos entre múltiplas normas em sistemas multiagentes},
	location = {Niterói},	
	abstract = {Em sistemas multiagentes abertos, normas são utilizadas para regular o comportamento 
dos agentes autônomos, heterogêneos e concebidos de forma independente. Normas descrevem 
o comportamento que pode ser executado, deve ser executado e não pode ser executado no 
sistema.  Um  dos  principais  desafios  no  desenvolvimento  de  sistemas  normativos  é  que  as 
normas podem entrar em conflito umas com as outras. Normas estão em conflito quando o 
cumprimento de uma norma viola a outra e vice-versa. Em trabalhos anteriores, os Conflict 
Checkers consideravam que conflitos podem ser detectados simplesmente analisando as normas 
em  pares.  Entretanto,  existem  conflitos  que  só  podem  ser  detectados  apenas  quando  várias 
normas  são  analisadas  em  conjunto. Este trabalho  apresenta  um  Conflict  Checker  capaz  de 
verificar  conflitos  entre  duas  ou  mais  normas  ao  mesmo  tempo.  A  estratégia  do  Conflict 
Checker é dividida em três passos: (1) aplicação de filtros para suavizar o custo computacional 
na  maioria  dos  casos,  pois,  o  problema  é  intrinsicamente  exponencial  (SHOHAM; 
TENNENHOLTZ, 1995), (2) transformação deôntica é utilizada para análise de várias normas 
ao mesmo tempo e (3) interseção entre as normas para verificação dos conflitos. Uma nova 
linguagem normativa mais expressiva, representada por uma gramática BNF, foi desenvolvida 
para definição de normas e um Conflict Checker foi implementado em formato de ferramenta. 
Dois princípios de validação foram aplicados: teste de software e verificação formal. O teste de 
software propôs inúmeros casos de teste para testar a capacidade de capturar conflitos e os 
benefícios da utilização dos filtros para suavizar a complexidade do problema. A verificação 
formal utilizou a técnica de DBC (Design-by-Contract - Design por Contrato) implementada 
pela JML (Java Modeling Language) na plataforma KeY para provar a corretude dos métodos. 
A estratégia desenvolvida nesta tese surge como uma nova sintaxe para definição e verificação 
de conflitos em sistemas multiagentes. },

	location = {Niterói},	
	abstract = {A constante evolução dos sistemas computacionais faz com que o uso de abordagens para a
gestão de requisitos de segurança seja uma necessidade contínua e crescente. Nestes sistemas,
um dos principais componentes de segurança é o controle de acesso. Políticas de controle de
acesso são um meio de definir acessos autorizados e não autorizados aos objetos. Estas políticas
autorizam, proíbem ou obrigam sujeitos a realizar ações sobre objetos. Nos sistemas em que
existem várias políticas descritas, conflitos entre tais políticas podem surgir. Duas políticas
estão em conflito, quando o cumprimento de uma política viola o cumprimento da outra política.
O conflito entre políticas pode ser detectado de maneira direta, observando a sobreposição de
atributos da política (isto é, sujeitos, ações e objetos) e de maneira indireta, através da análise
dos relacionamentos implícitos entre os atributos das duas políticas verificadas. Neste último
caso, os conflitos ocorrem entre as políticas que regulam o comportamento de diferentes, mas
relacionados sujeitos, especificando ações diferentes, mas relacionadas, que acessam diferentes,
mas relacionados, objetos. Este trabalho propõe uma abordagem para detectar esses tipos de
conflitos entre as diferentes políticas, concentrando-se principalmente no segundo tipo de
conflito, que denominamos de conflito indireto. Nesse sentido, as contribuições deste trabalho
incluem: a definição da política utilizada; um conjunto de relacionamentos que podem ocorrer
entre os atributos que compõe uma política (organização, sujeitos, papéis, objetos, visões, ação
e atividades); um conjunto de regras de propagação e de regras de conflitos. Três cenários com
políticas de sistemas reais são descritos na análise para detectar conflitos. A ferramenta
desenvolvida Conflict Detector recebe como entrada um conjunto de políticas de controle de
acesso, um conjunto de relacionamentos entre os atributos destas políticas e fornece como saída,
no caso da existência de conflitos, a identificação do conflito e as políticas que estão em
conflito.},

	abstract = {Relationship-based access control (ReBAC) is a flexible and expressive framework that allows policies to be expressed in terms of chains of relationship between entities as well as attributes of entities. ReBAC policy mining algorithms have a potential to significantly reduce the cost of migration from legacy access control systems to ReBAC, by partially automating the development of a ReBAC policy. Existing ReBAC policy mining algorithms support a policy language with a limited set of operators; this limits their applicability. This paper presents a ReBAC policy mining algorithm designed to be both (1) easily extensible (to support additional policy language features) and (2) scalable. The algorithm is based on Bui et al.'s evolutionary algorithm for ReBAC policy mining algorithm. First, we simplify their algorithm, in order to make it easier to extend and provide a methodology that extends it to handle new policy language features. However, extending the policy language increases the search space of candidate policies explored by the evolutionary algorithm, thus causes longer running time and/or worse results. To address the problem, we enhance the algorithm with a feature selection phase. The enhancement utilizes a neural network to identify useful features. We use the result of feature selection to reduce the evolutionary algorithm's search space. The new algorithm is easy to extend and, as shown by our experiments, is more efficient and produces better policies.},

Three types of networks were discussed: a multilayer feedforward network trained using the backpropagation algorithm, a sum-of-products network trained with a modification of backpropagation, and a new hybrid architecture that combines the two. A maximum classification accuracy of 97.5\% was achieved using a neural network based pattern classifier. Such approach can improve computer access security.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been a great effort to convert the existing Air Traffic Control system into a novel system known as Free Flight. Free Flight is based on the concept that increasing international airspace capacity will grant more freedom to individual pilots during the enroute flight phase, thereby giving them the opportunity to alter flight paths in real time. Under the current system, pilots must request, then receive permission from air traffic controllers to alter flight paths. Understandably the new system allows pilots to gain the upper hand in air traffic. At the same time, however, this freedom increase pilot responsibility. Pilots face a new challenge in avoiding the traffic shares congested air space. In order to ensure safety, an accurate system, able to predict and prevent conflict among aircraft is essential. There are certain flight maneuvers that exist in order to prevent flight disturbances or collision and these are graded in the following categories: vertical, lateral and airspeed. This work focuses on airspeed maneuvers and tries to introduce a new idea for the control of Free Flight, in three dimensions, using neural networks trained with examples prepared through non-linear programming.},

	abstract = {Modern distributed systems contain a large number of objects and must be capable of evolving, without shutting down the complete system, to cater for changing requirements. There is a need for distributed, automated management agents whose behavior also has to dynamically change to reflect the evolution of the system being managed. Policies are a means of specifying and influencing management behavior within a distributed system, without coding the behavior into the manager agents. Our approach is aimed at specifying implementable policies, although policies may be initially specified at the organizational level and then refined to implementable actions. We are concerned with two types of policies. Authorization policies specify what activities a manager is permitted or forbidden to do to a set of target objects and are similar to security access-control policies. Obligation policies specify what activities a manager must or must not do to a set of target objects and essentially define the duties of a manager. Conflicts can arise in the set of policies. Conflicts may also arise during the refinement process between the high level goals and the implementable policies. The system may have to cater for conflicts such as exceptions to normal authorization policies. The paper reviews policy conflicts, focusing on the problems of conflict detection and resolution. We discuss the various precedence relationships that can be established between policies in order to allow inconsistent policies to coexist within the system and present a conflict analysis tool which forms part of a role based management framework. Software development and medical environments are used as example scenarios.},

The adaptation of CPNN on the I-880 freeway in California was then investigated in both on-line and off-line environments. This paper also compares the performance of the CPNN model with a basic probabilistic neural network (BPNN) model. The results show that CPNN has three main advantages over BPNN: (1) CPNN has clustering ability and therefore could achieve similarly good incident-detection performance with a much smaller network size; (2) each Gaussian component in CPNN has its own smoothing parameter that can be obtained by the dynamic decay adjustment algorithm with a few epochs of training; and (3) the CPNN adaptation methods have the ability to prune obsolete Gaussian components and therefore the size of the network is always within control. CPNN has shown to have better application potentials than BPNN in this research.},

This paper evaluates three promising neural network models: multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MLF), basic probabilistic neural network (BPNN) and constructive probabilistic neural network (CPNN) for their incident detection performance. An important consideration in neural network-based incident detection systems is the deployment of a trained neural network on traffic systems with considerably different driving conditions. The models were developed and tested on an original freeway site in Singapore, and tested on a new freeway site in the US for their adaptability. The paper presents comparative evaluation in terms of their classification accuracy, adaptability, and network size. Results indicate that although the MLF model gives excellent classification results on the development site, the CPNN model outperforms the other two in terms of its adaptability and flexible structure. The results suggest that CPNN model has the highest potential for use in an operational automatic incident detection system for freeways.},

The basis of the approach is the IDES (Intruder Detection Expert System) which has two components, an expert system looking for evidence of attacks on known vulnerabilities of the system and a statistical model of the behavior of a user on the computer system under surveillance. This model learns the habits a user has when he works with the computer, and raises warnings when the current behavior is not consistent with the previously learned patterns. The authors suggest the time series approach to add broader scope to the model.

A new experiment confirmed predictions of this theory regarding the ERN and a second scalp potential, the N2, that is proposed to reflect conflict monitoring on correct response trials. Further analysis of the simulation data indicated that errors can be detected reliably on the basis of post-error conflict. It is concluded that the ERN can be explained in terms of response conflict and that monitoring for conflict may provide a simple mechanism for detecting errors.},

Significant attention has been dedicated in the past to the use of logical tools for the analysis of security policies, but this work has produced a limited impact on enterprise information systems. Important reasons of the limited success of past research were the difficult integration of these approaches with the technological scenario and the limited scalability of many proposals. Nowadays Semantic Web tools are increasingly used in modern information systems. We show how the tools provided by Semantic Web and ontology management technologies offer an adequate basis for the realization of techniques able to support conflict analysis in security policies. Based on the use of these techniques, we propose a solution for two different variants of conflict analysis: (a) Policy Incompatibility, and (b) Separation of Duty Satisfiability. Experiments that test the techniques on large security policies demonstrate the scalability of the approach.},
