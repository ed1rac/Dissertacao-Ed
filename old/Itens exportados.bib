	abstract = {We present the OWL API, a high level Application Programming Interface (API) for working with OWL ontologies. The OWL API is closely aligned with the OWL 2 structural specification. It supports parsing and rendering in the syntaxes defined in the W3C specification (Functional Syntax, RDF/XML, OWL/XML and the Manchester OWL Syntax); manipulation of ontological structures; and the use of reasoning engines. The reference implementation of the OWL API, written in Java, includes validators for the various OWL 2 profiles - OWL 2 QL, OWL 2 EL and OWL 2 RL. The OWL API has widespread usage in a variety of tools and applications.},
